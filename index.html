                  As a Storm Water Field Technician for the City of Ottawa's Stormwater Management Branch, <span class="bold">Sam Esser</span> is part
                  of a team dedicated to the revitalization of the Monahan wetlands. This work has seen a significant increase of wetland habitat
                  through the propagation and protection of key aquatic plant species. In addition to providing critical habitat for birds, reptiles,
                  and fish, these plants clean the water through the absorption and uptake of pollutants from upstream urban stormwater runoff. Sam's
                  work extends throughout the city where he assesses the function of different stormwater facilities relative to water quality and
                  quantity objectives. Before working for the City, he earned a Master's of Science at McGill University. He has had various
                  environmental roles in the private and public sector and even worked aboard commercial fishing vessels in the Bering Sea. When he's
                  not at work, you'll find him paddleboarding and fishing up and down the Rideau River.

                  was founded in 2017 by Metis artist, Patsea Griffin, following workshops where she would see some of her friends create the most
                  fabulous beadwork as well as other traditional and non-traditional artwork then tuck it away in a drawer, tin container, or ziplock
                  bag as was the case with her beadwork. Sometimes never to be seen again. "I decided that I wanted to show my work that took hours to
                  create and then I thought why not help others as well. There are so many talented people in the community that never get to show
                  their work. And it's amazing work." In 2021 The Thunderbird Sisters Collective became a not-for-profit organization whose goal is to
                  create youth-led safe spaces where it will be demonstrated that learning Indigenous knowledge is marketable and transferrable to
                  life experience, the workplace and the community. We're going to dream out loud.

                  MacCrimmon, and Maryem Tollar; four vocalists who individually have contributed widely to the Toronto world music scene and beyond.
                  Their work together focuses on interpretations of songs primarily from Greek, Turkish, Arabic and Balkan traditions with forays into
                  other genres when the inspiration moves them. Qanun, tambura, ukulele and various forms of hand percussion provide gentle
                  accompaniment to their arrangements, allowing their voices to remain front and centre. They love singing in pure traditional styles
                  but are also equally comfortable adding harmonies where no harmonies existed before. They are all highly adaptable musicians and
                  enjoy collaborating across genres. Their debut album "Nazar" garnered both Juno and CFMA nominations on its release.

                  <span class="bold"><a target="_blank" href="https://laurataler.ca/">Laura Taler</a></span> is a Romanian-born, award-winning artist,
                  filmmaker, choreographer, and performer with a 30-year career in collaborative art practices. Her experience with public art ranges
                  from large-scale performance works, to projections and screen-based works, to permanent installations. She expertly integrates
                  mediums, pushes boundaries, and uses technology simply and innovatively. Since the beginning of her career Laura has worked
                  collaboratively as the director of a team of artists and technicians. Through her company Grimm Pictures, founded in 1994, she has
                  produced work for a variety of small and large organizations. Laura's strength as an artist lies in her ability to provide a clear
                  vision to the team of experts that she gathers around each project and to guide that vision with precision and flexibility.

                  <span class="bold"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.remembernowmove.art/">Jocelyn Todd</a></span> is a dancer, choreographer,
                  producer and multi-disciplinary artist currently based in so-called Ottawa. Jocelyn works with the body and its interaction with the
                  present moment, environment, political landscape, sound, space, concept and other bodies. After graduating from The School of Dance
                  with a Diploma in Contemporary Dance Studies, Jocelyn split her time between Canada and England. In London, she delved into
                  self-curated and intensive periods of dance study, and presented her work in the Suffolk High Tide Festival and at London's Robin
                  Howard Theatre. She has also presented her choreographic works in Ottawa. Most recently (2020-2023):
                  <span class="italic">shell</span>, <span class="italic">the A-team</span> and <span class="italic">Time + Light</span>. Jocelyn's
                  film <span class="italic">Gold</span> was presented as part of Dance On Screen at the Mayfair Theatre in Fall 2021. She is deeply
                  thankful for the support of Ottawa Dance Directive and the communities that continue to nurture her, in Ottawa and London.
